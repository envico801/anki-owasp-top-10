Q: What makes an application vulnerable to security misconfigurations?  
A: An application is vulnerable to security misconfigurations if:  
- Appropriate security hardening is missing across any part of the application stack.  
- Permissions on cloud services are improperly configured.  
- Unnecessary features are enabled or installed.  
- Default accounts and their passwords remain enabled and unchanged.  
- Error handling reveals overly informative error messages.  
- Latest security features are disabled for upgraded systems.  
- Security settings in application servers, frameworks, libraries, databases, etc., are not configured securely.  
- Security headers or directives are missing or not set to secure values.  
- The software is out of date or vulnerable. (see [A06:2021-Vulnerable and Outdated Components](https://owasp.org/Top10/A06_2021-Vulnerable_and_Outdated_Components/)).
