Q: What are some indicators of insufficient logging and monitoring?  
A: Insufficient logging and monitoring occur when:  
- Auditable events like logins and high-value transactions are not logged.  
- Warnings and errors generate no, inadequate, or unclear log messages.  
- Logs of applications and APIs are not monitored for suspicious activity.  
- Logs are only stored locally.  
- Alerting thresholds and response escalation processes are absent or ineffective.  
- Penetration testing and DAST tool scans do not trigger alerts.  
- The application cannot detect, escalate, or alert for active attacks in real-time or near real-time.
