Q: What are some signs of authentication weaknesses in an application?  
A: Authentication weaknesses may be present if the application:  
- Permits automated attacks like credential stuffing.  
- Allows brute force or other automated attacks.  
- Permits the use of default, weak, or well-known passwords.  
- Uses ineffective credential recovery and forgot-password processes.  
- Stores passwords in plain text, encrypted, or weakly hashed formats.  
- Lacks or has ineffective multi-factor authentication.  
- Exposes session identifiers in the URL.  
- Reuses session identifiers after successful login.  
- Fails to correctly invalidate session IDs.
