Q: What are the characteristics of a secure session manager for preventing identification and authentication failures?  
A: Use a server-side, secure, built-in session manager that generates a new random session ID with high entropy after login. The session identifier should not be in the URL, be securely stored, and invalidated after logout, idle, and absolute timeouts.
