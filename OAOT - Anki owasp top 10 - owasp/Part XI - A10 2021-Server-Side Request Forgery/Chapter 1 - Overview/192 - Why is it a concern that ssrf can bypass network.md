Q: Why is it a concern that SSRF can bypass network access control mechanisms like firewalls and VPNs?  
A: SSRF is a concern because it allows attackers to coerce the application into sending requests to unexpected destinations even when protected by firewalls, VPNs, or other network access control lists (ACLs).
